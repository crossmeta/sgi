This document describes how to configure and build the open source XFS
commands and utilites ("xfsprogs") from source, and how to install and
run them.

0. If you have the binary rpm, simply install it and skip to step 2 (below).
   The rpm command to do this is:
	# rpm -Uvh xfsprogs

   The Debian command to do this is:
	# dpkg -i xfsprogs
   or, if you have apt configured (don't need the binary package):
	# apt-get install xfsprogs

1. Configure, build and install the package

   The xfsprogs package uses autoconf/configure and expects a GNU build
   environment (your platform must at least have both autoconf and gmake). 
   You will also need to have installed either the e2fsprogs-devel package
   (on an RPM based system) or the uuid-dev package (on a Debian system)
   as some of the commands make use of the UUID library provided by these.

   If you just want to spin an RPM and/or tar file, use the Makepkgs
   script in the top level directory. This will configure and build
   the package and leave binary and src RPMs in the build/rpm
   directory.  It will also leave a tar file in the build/tar
   directory.

       # ./Makepkgs verbose

   If you want to build the package and install it manually, use the
   following steps:

       # make configure  (or run autoconf; ./configure)
       # make
       # su root
       # make install

   Note that there are so many "install" variants out there that we
   wrote our own script (see "install-sh" in the top level directory).

   If you wish to turn off debugging asserts in the command build and
   turn on the optimizer then set the shell environment variables:

	OPTIMIZER=-O
	DEBUG=-DNDEBUG

   before running make configure or Makepkgs.

   contribute to the XFS project.
